# mern-crud-application

This is a sample CRUD application that allows for users to do basic data manipulations.

Tech Stack:

1. React+Redux for frontend rendering, routing and dynamic state management.
2. Node + Express for backend APIs.
3. MongoDB for dictionary data store. Mongoose server for quering data
4. Other basic libraries.

## How to start

1. Clone the repo
2. I have divided the UI and APIs into frontend and backend folders for ease in visbility, 
3. If you dont want to dive too deep into each component, I have used concurrently to daisy chain run commands.
4. Just hit `npm dev` and the node server should run consecutively with the react server.
5. I already have implemented a basic mongo instance, feel free to substitute or change as per preference.
6. Secrets have been left untouched deliberately, so that's it's easier to connect and configure.
